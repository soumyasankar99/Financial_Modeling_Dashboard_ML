## 🤖 What is Financial Modeling?

**Financial Modeling** refers to building abstract representations (models) of real-world financial scenarios. It involves:
- Tracking financial metrics
- Forecasting growth
- Analyzing trends
- Making decisions based on data

Our app lets you do this **without writing a single line of code** using machine learning and interactive dashboards.

## 🔍 Why We Built This

> To bridge the gap between **Finance** and **Data Science**.

💼 Professionals often use Excel for financial modeling but lack predictive power and automation. This project:
- Empowers non-technical users
- Automates data pipelines and reporting
- Enables smarter forecasting using ML
- Serves as a **data engineering + ML + analytics** portfolio project
